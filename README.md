# Detecting Lies and Fake News Using Econometric Methods

This repository contains an extended analysis based on the paper "Mistakes, Overconfidence, and the Effect of Sharing on Detecting Lies" by Marta Serra-Garcia and Uri Gneezy. This work builds upon their research by expanding the scope of analysis and exploring additional insights into how overconfidence affects people's ability to detect lies and how the act of sharing impacts the spread of misinformation.
